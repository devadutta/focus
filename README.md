# Minimal New Tab
a.k.a Focus.

Open source tool to help you cut off those nasty distractions. When you open a new tab, chrome shows you a speed dial which is a gateway to distraction. Instead, override the new tab page with a custom message and a day counter. You can reset the days counter whenever you want.

I use the day counter to count the number of days I have been able to stay focused. You can use it to count whatever you like.
